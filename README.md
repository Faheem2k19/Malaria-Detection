# Malaria-Detection
Malaria is an infectious disease which is very common in developing country like Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. The standard way of diagnosing malaria is by visually examining blood smears for parasite-infected red blood cells under the microscope by qualified technicians. This method is inefficient and the diagnosis depends on the experience and the knowledge of the person doing the examination. And In this project weâ€™ll be using deep learning to make that process more efficient, and our goal will be classify whether images of cell have been infected with Malaria or not.
